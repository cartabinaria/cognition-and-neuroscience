1. Compare and contrast electrical and chemical synapses, focusing on their structural differences, mechanisms of signal transmission, and functional implications for neural communication.

2. Explain the computational distinction between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning. How do these computational frameworks help us understand the cognitive processes underlying goal-directed and habitual behavior, and what evidence supports the idea that both systems contribute to behavior?

3. Describe the key functional and architectural similarities and differences between hierarchical convolutional neural networks (HCNNs) and the primate ventral visual pathway.
